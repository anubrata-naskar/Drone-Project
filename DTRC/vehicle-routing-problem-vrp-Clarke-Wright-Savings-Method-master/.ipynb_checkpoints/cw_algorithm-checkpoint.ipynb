    "The **Clark-Wright Savings Algorithm** is a heuristic used to solve the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**, specifically the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**. It aims to minimize the total distance traveled by a fleet of vehicles while servicing a set of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works in short:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Solution**: \n",
    "   - Start with an initial solution where each customer is served by a separate vehicle, resulting in a route that begins at the depot, visits one customer, and returns to the depot.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Savings Calculation**: \n",
    "   - For each pair of customers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), calculate the **savings** \\(S(i,j)\\), which represents the reduction in total travel distance when both customers are served by the same vehicle instead of separately. The savings formula is:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     S(i,j) = d(0,i) + d(0,j) - d(i,j)\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - \\(d(0,i)\\) is the distance from the depot to customer \\(i\\),\n",
    "     - \\(d(0,j)\\) is the distance from the depot to customer \\(j\\),\n",
    "     - \\(d(i,j)\\) is the distance between customer \\(i\\) and customer \\(j\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Route Merging**: \n",
    "   - Sort all pairs of customers by their savings in descending order.\n",
    "   - Starting from the highest savings, attempt to combine the two customers into a single route if:\n",
    "     - The combined route doesn't violate vehicle capacity constraints.\n",
    "     - No other conflicting routes are formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterative Improvement**: \n",
    "   - Continue merging pairs of customers (if feasible) until no more profitable merges are possible, or all customers are assigned to routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Solution**: \n",
    "   - The result is a set of routes for each vehicle that minimizes the total travel distance while respecting the vehicle capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Heuristic**: It’s not guaranteed to find the optimal solution but provides a good, feasible solution in a reasonable time.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: It's relatively efficient and can handle larger instances of the VRP.\n",
    "- **Savings**: The idea is to maximize the \"savings\" in distance by combining customer routes efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is a greedy algorithm, focusing on improving the solution step by step based on the savings criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clark-Wright Savings Algorithm (Algorithm 6.7)\n",
    "- STEP \t1: \tCalculate the savings s(i, j) = d(D, i) + d(D, j) - d(i, j) for every pair (i, j) of demand nodes.\n",
    "- STEP \t2: \tRank the savings s(i, j) and list them in descending order of magnitude. This creates the \"savings list.\" Process the savings list beginning with the topmost entry in the list (the largest s(i, j)).\n",
    "- STEP \t3: \tFor the savings s(i, j) under consideration, include link (i, j) in a route if no route constraints will be violated through the inclusion of (i, j) in a route, and if:\n",
    "\n",
    "     a. Either, neither i nor j have already been assigned to a route, in which case a new route is initiated including both i and j.\n",
    "\n",
    "     b. Or, exactly one of the two nodes (i or j) has already been included in an existing route and that point is not interior to that route (a point is interior to a route if it is not adjacent to the depot D in the order of traversal of nodes), in which case the link (i, j) is added to that same route.\n",
    "\n",
    "     c. Or, both i and j have already been included in two different existing routes and neither point is interior to its route, in which case the two routes are merged.\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "- STEP \t4: \tIf the savings list s(i, j) has not been exhausted, return to Step 3, processing the next entry in the list; otherwise, stop: the solution to the VRP consists of the routes created during Step 3. (Any nodes that have not been assigned to a route during Step 3 must each be served by a vehicle route that begins at the depot D visits the unassigned point and returns to D.) "
